# ROCKET ENGINE SOLVER

Rocket Engine Solver (RES) is a software project conducted by the Raider Aerospace Society (RAS) of Texas Tech University under the lead of user [KyleM8](https://github.com/KyleM8).

RES will perform  calculations on aspects of rocket engines such as flow rate, nozzle diameter, and thrust. The code is largely based on open-source Java code by NASA as well as other open-source resources. RES adapts the open-source reference code, along with new code, into a C# WPF application for ease-of-use in the design phase of rocket engines.

#### CONTRIBUTING

This repository uses the fork / pull request / merge system for contributions.

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub repository, download your forked repo, and ensure the local folder and your forked repo are linked.

In order to contribute to this repo, please do the following:
- Once you have written your contribution, ensure that your local copy of the repo is up to date, and push and commit your changes to a separate branch on your forked repo.
    - Branch Naming Convention: Please use the following branch naming convention: yyyymmdd_User_#
        - Where: yyyymmdd is the year, month, and day of the branch creation; User is the user making the branch and pull request; and # is the branch number for the day (start with 1, and if there are multiple branches for the same day, continue on to 2, 3, and so on).
    - IMPORTANT: Do NOT make a pull request from the same branch multiple times in the same day! If you have more changes after you've made a pull request, make a new branch using the conventions listed above and make a new pull request from the new branch. (Try not to do this often, though, because resolving conflicts is a headache for the repo admin, and the more pull requests there are, the higher the chance for a conflict.)
- After you push and commit your changes to your branch, go to the GitHub website, ensure everything is in order, and make a pull request from your branch to the main/master. Ensure your changes and contributions are documented in the pull request so the repo admin can evaluate it.
    - If everything is in order, the repo admin will merge the branch with the main/master. No action is required on the part of the contributor for this step.
- Finally, before writing more code or making further contributions, be sure to update your fork and your local copy of the forked repo. Repeat the steps above.
